### Hi. It is weird that I have been building websites for a realy long time but I have no experience with real hands-on coding. Thanks to Wordpress. Today, I will begin learning html, css, js, python, and their popular frameworks so I get familiar with them and actually use them to create really good projects. Okay, let's go!
